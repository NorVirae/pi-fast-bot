# 🚀 Pi Network Sweeper Bot
## I am making this code public to help folks whose pi wallet have been compromised have a chance at recovery.
## Feel Free to contribute and modify code as you wish

**Claim All & Continuous Flood**  
An automated Stellar-based bot for the Pi Network that **claims all available claimable balances** for a wallet and aggressively participates in bidding wars until manually stopped.

---

## ⚙️ Features

- 🔁 Infinite claim loop for continuous sweeping
- 🔄 Dynamic fee adjustment to win bidding wars
- 💸 Automatically transfers claimed balances to a destination wallet
- 💥 Floods the network with multiple transaction duplicates per success
- 🔐 Mnemonic-based key management for both claimant and sponsor
- 🌐 Uses Stellar SDK for network interaction

---

## 🛠️ Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NorVirae/pi-fast-bot.git
cd pi-network-sweeper-bot
npm install

## To compete
- You need to run the bot on same region with Pi node
- I deduced Most of the bots from their TPS are running their bots on aws metal servers.
